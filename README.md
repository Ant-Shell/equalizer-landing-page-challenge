### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I'm working on improving my skills with responsiveness, so this challenge was great!

### Continued development

I'm definitely going to do more exploration on when to use REM vs. EM vs. Pixels. I used pixels for the majority of styling on this challenge, so I may have been missing out on some advantages of the other units.
